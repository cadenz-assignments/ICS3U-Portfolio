                1. Khan Academy: Intro to HTML/CSS
            </h2>
            <img src="resources/images/html_css.png" alt="html-css" style="float: right;">
            <p>
                This module was my introduction to HTML/CSS. I had a brief understanding what they were and what they were supposed to do, but never sat down and learned them. Web development was and still is fairly new to me. I have a lot more experience in developing websites now then I did at the start of the course. Both my personal projects and the khan academy helped me get into web development.

                2. Khan Academy: Intro to Javascript
            </h2>

            <p style="font-size: 1.6vw;">
                I already had a brief understanding of javascript and how to code with it before the course, but it was not in depth. After this module I was able to understand the concept of prototypes, and other programming concepts and how to use them effectively in Javascript. This certainly helped in my web development journey.

            <p style="font-size: 1.6vw;">
                When I reached this module, I already had a decent understanding of Javascript. So I was able to quickly complete this module with no issue. This was mostly a practice module for me. It didn't teach me anything new to me, but it was able to reinforce some ideas and concepts.

            <p style="font-size: 1.6vw;">
                This module was able to teach me how to use the parts of Github that I have not really touched on before, such as Github Pages, and PRs. It was also able to reinforce my ability to write vanilla HTML and Markdown.

                5. The General Exploration of Git/Github

            <img src="resources/images/git.png" alt="html-css" style="width: 7vw; float: left; margin-right: 2vw; margin-top: 2vh;">
            <p style="font-size: 1.6vw; margin-right: 2vw;">
                In this module, I was able to explore git/github myself, and complete the learn git branching mini lesson. This was actually one of the most useful modules so far. I was unfimiliar with all the different things you can with Git Branching before this module. This module taught me different ways of branching, moving code, commiting code, and etc.

            <p style="font-size: 1.8vw;">
                The Microbit module was exciting at the beginning. But the realization of it can not do all we wanted it to do at the beginning was slightly disappointing. Either way, it was able to teach me to look out for emerging technologies out there.

            <p style="font-size: 1.8vw;">
                This module was fairly fun, since we were able to choose what we wanted to do. It was able to teach me the difficulty of working as a group with people of different skill sets. It was also able to teach me that when choosing projects to work on, a feasible option should be on the top of the list.
